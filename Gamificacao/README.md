# Gamification Application Using TDD 

Application coded based on test-driven development, using Java 8, JUnit 5 and Eclipse IDE 2020-09, and following the business requirements especified by Coursera/ITA (Instituto Tecnologico da Aeronautica). I've developed the suite of unit test cases and integration test cases during the iteation processo of TTD. For Unit testing I've used mock to replace the external dependencies through out the use of dependency injection pattern, in special, the driver class responsible for writing TXT files in disk. the Integration testing exercized all classes and all external dependencies, so it could replect the real deployment environment during the automated testing.
